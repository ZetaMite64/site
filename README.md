# The Dream about Stallman
i once had a dream that richard stallman was a family member of mine(maybe
an uncle or something idk).
i kept trying to get a picture with him but people kept gettinng in the way
and finally he left the house.
he went to a burger king in a place that looked like kyrgyzstan or mongolia.
he looked depressed.
i was too scared to go up to him to take a picture because well, i cann't
actually remember but i think it was because my camera ran proprietary
software or something.
but then stallman got naked and started laying on the table.
nobody seemed to care.
i can't remember much after that.
